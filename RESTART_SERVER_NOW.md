# 🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER!

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM

You're still seeing "Please connect Discord first" because **the server is still running the OLD code!**

Backend changes don't take effect until you restart the Node.js process!

---

## ✅ HOW TO RESTART

### **Step 1: Stop the Server**

In your terminal where `node server.js` is running:

**Press `Ctrl+C`**

You should see the server stop.

### **Step 2: Start the Server Again**

Run:
```bash
node server.js
```

Wait for:
```
Supabase client initialized successfully
OAuth server running on port 3000
```

### **Step 3: Test Again**

1. **Refresh browser** (`Ctrl+R`)
2. **Click "CONNECT X"**
3. **Authorize in popup**
4. **Should work now!**

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY SERVER RESTARTED

When you connect X, check the **server console** (not browser console).

You should see:
```
✅ New Twitter connection - will be linked to Discord session by frontend
```

**NOT:**
```
❌ Twitter account not in database
⚠️ User must connect Discord FIRST
```

If you still see the old error message, the server didn't restart properly.
