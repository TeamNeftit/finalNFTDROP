# ✅ Sequential Tasks Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented a **session-based sequential task system** where:

1. **Discord is FIRST** - Creates the user session (UUID)
2. **X/Twitter is SECOND** - Links to the same UUID
3. **Wallet is THIRD** - Links to the same UUID

All data saves in **ONE ROW** per user in the database.

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **1. Discord Connection (First Task)**
```
User clicks "CONNECT DISCORD"
  ↓
OAuth completes → Creates NEW user in database
  ↓
Stores Discord ID in localStorage
  ↓
UI unlocks X task
```

**Database:** Creates new row with `discord_provider_id`

### **2. X/Twitter Connection (Second Task)**
```
User clicks "CONNECT X"
  ↓
Frontend checks: Is Discord connected? (localStorage)
  ├─ NO → Shows error "Connect Discord first"
  └─ YES → Opens OAuth popup
      ↓
OAuth completes → Calls /api/link-twitter-to-session
  ↓
Backend checks:
  - Is this X account already used? → Error if yes
  - Does Discord session exist? → Error if no
  - Is wallet already submitted? → Error if yes (locked)
  ↓
Adds X data to SAME UUID
  ↓
UI unlocks Wallet task
```

**Database:** Updates same row with `twitter_provider_id`

### **3. Wallet Submission (Third Task)**
```
User enters wallet → Clicks "SUBMIT"
  ↓
Frontend checks: Is Discord connected? (localStorage)
  ├─ NO → Shows error
  └─ YES → Calls /api/link-wallet-to-session
      ↓
Backend checks:
  - Is this wallet already used? → Error if yes
  - Does Discord session exist? → Error if no
  - Is X connected? → Error if no
  ↓
Adds wallet to SAME UUID
  ↓
UI shows all tasks completed
```

**Database:** Updates same row with `wallet_address`

## 🗄️ Database Structure

**ONE ROW per user:**
```
users table:
  id: UUID (primary key)
  discord_provider_id: "123456789" ← Created first
  discord_username: "user#1234"
  discord_joined: true/false
  twitter_provider_id: "987654321" ← Added second
  twitter_username: "username"
  wallet_address: "0x123..." ← Added third
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
```

---

## 🔐 Session Restoration

**When user returns:**
```
Page loads
  ↓
Checks localStorage for Discord ID
  ↓
If found → Calls /api/session/:discordUserId
  ↓
Loads all completed tasks:
  - Discord: completed/in_progress
  - X: locked/unlocked/completed
  - Wallet: locked/unlocked/completed
  ↓
Updates UI with correct button states
```

## ✅ Validation Rules

### **Discord:**
- ✅ Can reconnect anytime (restores session)
- ❌ Cannot reuse if wallet already submitted

### **X/Twitter:**
- ✅ Can connect if Discord is connected
- ❌ Cannot connect if Discord not connected first
- ❌ Cannot reuse X account from another session
- ❌ Cannot change if wallet already submitted

### **Wallet:**
- ✅ Can submit if Discord + X connected
- ❌ Cannot submit if Discord not connected
- ❌ Cannot submit if X not connected
- ❌ Cannot reuse wallet from another session

## 🆕 New API Endpoints

### **POST /api/link-twitter-to-session**
Links X to existing Discord session
```json
{
  "discordUserId": "123456789",
  "twitterUserId": "987654321",
  "twitterUsername": "username",
  "twitterEmail": "email@example.com"
}
```

### **POST /api/link-wallet-to-session**
Links wallet to existing session
```json
{
  "discordUserId": "123456789",
  "walletAddress": "0x123..."
}
```

### **GET /api/session/:discordUserId**
Gets complete session state
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "discord_connected": true,
    "twitter_connected": true,
    "wallet_connected": false,
    "tasks": {
      "discord": "completed",
      "twitter": "unlocked",
      "wallet": "locked"
    }
  }
}
```

- Buttons are disabled on locked tasks

### **Session Persistence:**
- Discord ID stored in localStorage
- Page reload restores full session
- Shows correct button states (Connect/Follow/Verify/Completed)

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Your sequential task system is now fully implemented. Users must:
1. Connect Discord first
2. Then connect X
3. Then submit wallet

All data saves in ONE row per user, and sessions persist across page reloads!
