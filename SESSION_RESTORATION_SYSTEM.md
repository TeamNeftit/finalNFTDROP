# ✅ SESSION RESTORATION SYSTEM - LOGIN WITH DISCORD

## 🎯 What This Does

Users can now **log back in with just their Discord account** and see all their previously completed tasks!

### **Scenarios:**

1. **User completed Discord + X:**
   - Logs in with Discord → Shows Discord ✓ and X ✓

2. **User completed all 3 tasks:**
   - Logs in with Discord → Shows Discord ✓, X ✓, and Wallet ✓

3. **New user:**
   - Connects Discord → Starts fresh with only Discord task

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. Backend (server.js) - Lines 801-845**

**Before:**
- Blocked users who had submitted wallet
- Showed error: "Account already connected with wallet"

**After:**
- Always restores session for existing Discord accounts
- Sends `restored: true` flag
- Frontend handles showing completed tasks

```javascript
// Always restore session for existing Discord accounts
console.log('✅ Restoring Discord session');
console.log('📊 Session status:', {
    hasDiscord: !!existingUser.discord_provider_id,
    hasTwitter: !!existingUser.twitter_provider_id,
    hasWallet: !!existingUser.wallet_address,
    discordJoined: !!existingUser.discord_joined
});

// Send success with existing user ID - frontend will restore full session
return res.send(`
    <script>
        window.opener.postMessage({
            type: 'DISCORD_AUTH_SUCCESS',
            userId: '${userId}',
            restored: true
        }, '${BASE_URL}');
    </script>
`);
```

### **2. Frontend (script.js) - Lines 145-197**

**Added complete task restoration:**

```javascript
// Update X UI
if (session.twitter_connected) {
    console.log('✅ Twitter connected - marking X task as completed');
    
    // Mark X task as completed
    completedTasks.follow = true;
    updateTaskUI('follow');
    
    // Show verify button as completed
    verifyBtn.innerHTML = '<span class="button-text">✓ Completed</span>';
    verifyBtn.disabled = true;
    verifyBtn.style.backgroundColor = '#10b981';
}

// Update Wallet UI
if (session.wallet_connected) {
    console.log('✅ Wallet connected - marking address task as completed');
    completedTasks.address = true;
    updateTaskUI('address');
    
    // Show wallet as submitted
    addressInput.value = session.wallet_address;
    addressInput.disabled = true;
    submitBtn.innerHTML = '<span class="button-text">✓ Submitted</span>';
    submitBtn.disabled = true;
}
```

## 🔄 Complete Flow

### **Scenario 1: User Completed All Tasks, Clears Data, Logs Back In**

```
1. User clears browser data (localStorage cleared)

2. User clicks "CONNECT DISCORD"
   → Discord OAuth popup opens

3. User authorizes Discord
   → Backend checks database
   → Finds existing account with:
     - discord_joined: true
     - twitter_connected: true
     - wallet_address: "0x123..."

4. Backend sends: DISCORD_AUTH_SUCCESS with restored: true

5. Frontend receives message
   → Calls loadSessionFromDiscord()
   → Gets session from database
   → Restores ALL completed tasks:
     ✓ Discord task (green "✓ Completed")
     ✓ X task (green "✓ Completed")
     ✓ Wallet task (green "✓ Submitted")

6. UI shows all tasks completed!
```

### **Scenario 2: User Completed Discord + X Only**

```
1. User logs in with Discord

2. Backend finds account with:
   - discord_joined: true
   - twitter_connected: true
   - wallet_address: null

3. Frontend restores:
   ✓ Discord task (completed)
   ✓ X task (completed)
   ⚪ Wallet task (unlocked, ready to submit)

4. User can now submit wallet address
```

### **Scenario 3: New User**

```
1. User clicks "CONNECT DISCORD"

2. Backend checks database
   → Discord account NOT found

3. Backend creates new user
   → Sends restored: false

4. Frontend shows:
   ✓ Discord task (just connected)
   🔒 X task (locked, needs to join Discord server)
   🔒 Wallet task (locked)
```

## 🚀 Test Now

### **Step 1: Restart Server**

**CRITICAL:** Backend changes require server restart!

```bash
# Stop server: Ctrl+C
# Start server:

```

### **Step 2: Test Session Restoration**

1. **Complete all tasks** (Discord, X, Wallet)

2. **Clear browser data:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Console tab
   - Run: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Refresh page

3. **Click "CONNECT DISCORD"**

4. **Authorize Discord**

5. **Check UI:**
   - ✅ Discord should show "✓ Completed"
   - ✅ X should show "✓ Completed"
   - ✅ Wallet should show "✓ Submitted" with your address

### **Step 3: Check Console Logs**

You should see:
```
✅ Session loaded: {discord_joined: true, twitter_connected: true, wallet_connected: true}
✅ Discord is JOINED - showing completed state
✅ Twitter connected - marking X task as completed
✅ Wallet connected - marking address task as completed
📊 Final completedTasks: {follow: true, discord: true, address: true}
```

## 📊 Database Session Structure

The `/api/session/{discordUserId}` endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session": {
    "id": "b1cc3475-8d38-49e4-a4d5-ff91e453d4b9",
    "discord_provider_id": "1306888014408187967",
    "discord_connected": true,
    "discord_joined": true,
    "twitter_provider_id": "123456789",
    "twitter_connected": true,
    "wallet_address": "0x123...",
    "wallet_connected": true,
    "tasks": {
      "discord": "completed",
      "twitter": "unlocked",
      "wallet": "unlocked"
    }
  }
}
```

Frontend uses this to restore:
- `discord_joined: true` → Show Discord as completed
- `twitter_connected: true` → Show X as completed
- `wallet_connected: true` → Show Wallet as submitted
