This feature not only adds a layer of gamification and strategy but also strengthens the long-term value and utility of NFTs within the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### How the Burn System Works\r\n\r\nUsers can upgrade their NFTs by burning specific combinations of lower-rarity NFTs. This process is tier-based and requires users to climb through multiple upgrade layers before reaching the ultimate reward.\r\n\r\n**Upgrade Tiers:**\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Common, Rare, Legendary** → **Platinum**\r\n   * Burn 5 Common NFTs        → 1 Platinum NFT\r\n   * Burn 3 Rare NFTs          → 1 Platinum NFT\r\n   * Burn 2 Legendary NFTs     → 1 Platinum NFT\r\n\r\n2. **Platinum → Silver**\r\n   * Burn 5 Platinum NFTs → 1 Silver NFT\r\n\r\n3. **Silver → Gold**\r\n   * Burn 5 Silver NFTs → 1 Gold NFT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hierarchy makes Gold NFTs the rarest and most valuable assets in the NEFTIT ecosystem.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Burn Access: Campaign-Based Limit\r\n\r\nTo ensure fairness and discourage users from simply purchasing large numbers of NFTs from marketplaces and fast-tracking upgrades, NEFTIT introduces a **burn restriction mechanism**:\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Each completed campaign unlocks 3 burn chances.**\r\n\r\nThis means users must actively participate in campaigns to earn the right to burn NFTs and progress through upgrade tiers, regardless of how many NFTs they own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why Burn-to-Upgrade Matters\r\n\r\n* **Gamified Progression  :** Users build strategy by collecting, timing, and choosing when and how to burn.\r\n* **Reduced NFT Supply    :** Burning removes NFTs from circulation, adding scarcity and value to remaining ones.\r\n* **On-Chain Reputation   :** Higher-tier NFTs (Platinum, Silver, Gold) can unlock exclusive roles, staking benefits, or governance rights.\r\n* **Fair Ecosystem Growth :** Prevents whales from bypassing engagement by simply buying and upgrading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Final Gold NFTs\r\n\r\nGold NFTs are designed to be ultra-rare and only achievable by:\r\n\r\n* Participating in multiple campaigns\r\n* Strategically burning through the tier structure\r\n* Remaining active in the ecosystem\r\n\r\nGold NFTs may come with premium benefits, including access to exclusive airdrops, future governance roles, or high-yield staking opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Benefits of Gold NFTs:**\r\n\r\n* Highest NEFT point yield\r\n* Governance participation\r\n* Access to premium and gated campaigns\r\n* Future rewards eligibility\r\n* role in Discord + on-platform badges\r\n* some rewards from partnerred projects (not guaranteed)\r\n* Discounts on NEFTIT and other partnered platform\r\n* access to special events, AMAs, and exclusive content.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis burn-to-upgrade system keeps NEFTIT's reward layer dynamic, interactive, and merit-based. It’s not just about what you hold, it’s about how you earned it.\r\n"],"names":["children","_jsx","_components","strong"],"mappings":"sMAAEA,SAAA,8CAEFA,SAAA,yYAIKA,SAAA,8CAELA,SAAA,6PAEEA,SAAA,wHAGGA,SAAA,4BAAyB,MAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAKH,SAAA,6DAC9BA,SAAA,gEACAA,SAAA,gEACAA,SAAA,oIAEAA,SAAA,qEACAA,SAAA,6HAEAA,SAAA,iEACAA,SAAA,4EAGLA,SAAA,qIAIKA,SAAA,uDAELA,SAAA,CAAA,0JAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAyJH,SAAA,+BAA4B,6EAGjLA,SAAA,8EAEJA,SAAA,sLAIKA,SAAA,wGAEDA,SAAA,4BAAyB,iIACzBA,SAAA,4BAAyB,sIACzBA,SAAA,4BAAyB,gKACzBA,SAAA,4BAAyB,yGAIxBA,SAAA,oCAELA,SAAA,iHAEEA,SAAA,yDACAA,SAAA,sEACAA,SAAA,8DAEFA,SAAA,6LAIEA,SAAA,0EAEAA,SAAA,8CACAA,SAAA,8CACAA,SAAA,2DACAA,SAAA,gDACAA,SAAA,0DACAA,SAAA,4EACAA,SAAA,sEACAA,SAAA,uGAIFA,SAAA"}
