{"version":3,"file":"privacy-policy-jZ-f4DWR.js","sources":["../../neftit_docs-content/legal-compliance-risk/privacy-policy.mdx"],"sourcesContent":["# Privacy Policy\r\n\r\n**Effective Date:** May 1, 2025\\\r\n**Last Updated:** May 1, 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEFTIT (\"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us\") is committed to safeguarding the privacy and data of its users (\"you\" or \"users\"). This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we may collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have with respect to your information when you access or use any part of the NEFTIT platform, including our website, applications, services, smart contracts, and affiliated features (collectively, the \"Platform\").\r\n\r\nNEFTIT is an early-stage, decentralized Web3 platform that leverages blockchain, NFT technologies, social engagement tools, and decentralized data structures to deliver gamified growth for Web3 projects. As such, our privacy practices combine conventional web standards with blockchain-native architecture. By using NEFTIT, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use the platform.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**1. Information We Collect**\r\n\r\n**1.1 Wallet and Blockchain Data** We collect your public wallet address (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.) when you connect a wallet via WalletConnect, MetaMask, Phantom, or other integrations. This wallet address may be associated with on-chain transactions, NFT holdings, and staking or burning activity within the NEFTIT ecosystem. All data stored on-chain is inherently public and transparent, though we do not link wallet addresses to off-chain identities unless explicitly provided.\r\n\r\n**1.2 Social Media and Campaign Interactions** When participating in social tasks, campaigns, or referral systems, you may be required to connect or authorize third-party accounts, such as X (Twitter), Discord, Telegram, Lens, or Farcaster. We collect and store necessary identifiers and metadata to validate task completion (e.g., Twitter handle, tweet IDs, follower count, Discord ID, participation timestamps, etc.). We may store this data for rewards distribution, anti-fraud mechanisms, and campaign performance evaluation.\r\n\r\n**1.3 Technical Data** We automatically collect certain data from your device and browser when you visit our website. This may include IP address, device type, browser type, screen resolution, referring URLs, locale settings, and usage patterns (e.g., page views, time spent, clicks). We use this data for security monitoring, debugging, analytics, and platform optimization.\r\n\r\n**1.4 Voluntarily Provided Data** You may choose to provide us with additional personal information through contact forms, bug reports, feedback tools, surveys, support requests, or during potential future KYC/AML procedures. Examples include email addresses, names, feedback messages, or identification documents (if required by law in the future).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. How We Use Your Information**\r\n\r\n* To enable wallet-based access to the platform\r\n* To track and verify campaign or task engagement\r\n* To issue and deliver NFTs, points, or rewards based on user activity\r\n* To prevent fraud, Sybil attacks, multi-accounting, or referral abuse\r\n* To improve user experience, system performance, and campaign analytics\r\n* To notify you about campaign results, updates, or security incidents\r\n* To comply with legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations (if applicable)\r\n* To initiate contact, if you've provided contact details\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**3. Data Sharing and Disclosure**\r\n\r\n**3.1 Third-Party Services** We may share limited user data with third-party services strictly necessary for platform operations. Examples include blockchain explorers, decentralized file storage providers (e.g., IPFS or Arweave), analytics platforms (e.g., Plausible, Google Analytics), fraud prevention APIs, or integrations with social media platforms for task verification. All such third parties are required to process user data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and only for the purposes authorized by NEFTIT.\r\n\r\n**3.2 Legal Requirements** We may disclose personal data if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to enforce our Terms of Service; to prevent fraud or security threats; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of NEFTIT, its users, or the public.\r\n\r\n**3.3 Business Transfers** In the future, if NEFTIT becomes part of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users prior to any such transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**4. Data Retention and Security**\r\n\r\nWe retain collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We use modern security tools, firewalls, encryption, and access controls to protect stored data. However, no online platform can guarantee absolute security. Users are strongly advised to secure their wallets, maintain private key confidentiality, and avoid phishing attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**5. Cookies and Local Storage**\r\n\r\nWe may use cookies, local storage, or browser-based databases to remember user preferences, detect spam/fraud behavior, and optimize loading performance. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but this may impair some functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**6. User Rights**\r\n\r\nDepending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain data protection rights, such as:\r\n\r\n* The right to access your data\r\n* The right to correct inaccurate or incomplete data\r\n* The right to request data deletion (subject to smart contract limitations)\r\n* The right to object to or restrict processing\r\n* The right to data portability\r\n* The right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority\r\n\r\nTo exercise these rights, you can contact us at team@neftit.xyz. Please note, however, that we may not be able to delete or modify on-chain data due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**7. Children's Privacy**\r\n\r\nNEFTIT is not directed toward or intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without verified parental or legal guardian consent. If we learn that a child has submitted personal data to us without appropriate authorization, we will delete the data as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**8. International Data Transfers**\r\n\r\nOur servers and third-party partners may be located in jurisdictions outside your own, which may not provide the same level of data protection. By using NEFTIT, you acknowledge and agree that your data may be transferred, processed, and stored outside of your country of residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**9. Bug Reporting, Abuse, and Whistleblowing**\r\n\r\nWe encourage responsible disclosure of bugs, vulnerabilities, or abuse via our dedicated contact channel. Ethical researchers and users may report issues to: team@neftit.xyz. We do not offer bounties at this stage but are open to future partnerships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**10. Updates to This Policy**\r\n\r\nWe reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. If material changes are made, we may notify users via email or platform announcements. Continued use of NEFTIT following updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**11. Contact Us**\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, concerns, or requests related to this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled, you can contact our legal and compliance team at:\r\n\r\n**Email:** team@neftit.xyz\\\r\n**Official Website:** https://neftit.xyz\\\r\n**Discord:** https://discord.gg/neftit\\\r\n**X (Twitter):** https://x.com/neftitxyz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Closing Statement**\r\n\r\nNEFTIT is built with respect for decentralization, privacy, and user rights at its core. We believe in radical transparency and minimal data collection. However, Web3 is still evolving, and regulatory frameworks are in flux. We will always work to balance innovation, community freedom, and compliance while protecting your data in the most ethical way possible.\r\n\r\nThank you for trusting NEFTIT. Letâ€™s build the future of growth, together.\r\n\r\n"],"names":["children","_jsx","_components","br","strong","a"],"mappings":"oMAAEA,SAAA,8DAEAA,SAAA,oBAAiB,eAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,GAAA,IAAA,KAAAF,EAAAA,IAAAC,EAAAE,OAAA,CACjBJ,SAAA,kBAAe,kCAIjBA,SAAA,2dAEAA,SAAA,weAIEA,SAAA,2EAEAA,SAAA,mCAAgC,6fAEhCA,SAAA,+CAA4C,mhBAE5CA,SAAA,uBAAoB,kZAEpBA,SAAA,kCAA+B,2WAI/BA,SAAA,kFAEAA,SAAA,mEACAA,SAAA,qEACAA,SAAA,0FACAA,SAAA,0FACAA,SAAA,4FACAA,SAAA,0FACAA,SAAA,kGACAA,SAAA,6GAIAA,SAAA,gFAEAA,SAAA,6BAA0B,kiBAE1BA,SAAA,2BAAwB,4VAExBA,SAAA,2BAAwB,oQAIxBA,SAAA,qDAEFA,SAAA,seAIEA,SAAA,mDAEFA,SAAA,iSAIEA,SAAA,qCAEFA,SAAA,uIAEEA,SAAA,mDACAA,SAAA,wEACAA,SAAA,gGACAA,SAAA,mEACAA,SAAA,mDACAA,SAAA,6FAEFA,SAAA,CAAA,mDAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAG,EAAA,+BAAgDL,SAAA,oBAAe,sLAI7DA,SAAA,4CAEFA,SAAA,ubAIEA,SAAA,sDAEFA,SAAA,uUAIEA,SAAA,mEAEFA,SAAA,CAAA,iKAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAG,EAAA,+BAA8JL,SAAA,oBAAe,4HAI3KA,SAAA,iDAEFA,SAAA,gWAIEA,SAAA,qCAEFA,SAAA,0MAEEA,SAAA,WAAQ,IAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAG,EAAA,+BAACL,SAAA,wDACTA,SAAA,sBAAmB,IAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAG,EAAA,8BAACL,SAAA,yBAAmB,OAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAE,OAAA,CACvCJ,SAAA,aAAU,IAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAG,EAAA,qCAACL,SAAA,gCAA0B,OAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAE,OAAA,CACrCJ,SAAA,iBAAc,IAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAG,EAAA,gCAACL,SAAA,wEAIfA,SAAA,wCAEFA,SAAA,+XAEAA,SAAA"}
