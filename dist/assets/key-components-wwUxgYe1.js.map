Each component below plays a distinct role in delivering a seamless, secure, and scalable gamified experience for users, projects, and contributors.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 1. Campaign Engine (Task to NFT Framework)\r\n\r\nAt the core of NEFTIT is a **campaign engine** that enables Web3 projects to launch social tasks such as follows, reposts, comments, and invites that users can complete to **earn free NFTs** and other on-chain or off-chain rewards.\r\n\r\n* Fully customizable campaigns (task type, start/end time, number of winners)\r\n* Campaign specific NFT drop setup with custom NFTs and metadata\r\n* Social media task verification via APIs (Twitter, Discord, Telegram)\r\n* Multi-task structure with checkpoints, boosters, and tiered rewards\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 2. NFT Reward Distribution System\r\n\r\nNEFTIT leverages NFTs not just as collectibles, but as **identity assets and proof-of-participation units**. Each campaign drops unique NFTs to users based on task performance, rarity logic, and anti-bot validation.\r\n\r\n* NEFTIT characters NFTs, new designs per campaign\r\n* Optional metadata linking to task or project milestones\r\n* Stored on decentralised storages with multichain claim logic\r\n* NFTs are upgradeable, burnable, and stakeable in NEFTIT\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 3. Burn-to-Upgrade Mechanism\r\n\r\nA core gamification layer within NEFTIT is its **burn-to-upgrade engine**, where users can burn low-tier NFTs to receive higher-rarity versions, unlock perks, or improve their NEFT Point yield.\r\n\r\n* Encourages long-term engagement and discourages airdrop farming\r\n* Layered upgrade paths linked to wallet score and prior participation\r\n* Deflationary NFT mechanics built into campaign structures\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 4. NEFT Points System\r\n\r\nNEFT Points are a **non-tokenized loyalty metric** that measure a user’s contribution across campaigns. Points are earned through task completions, referrals, campaign wins, achievements, daily check-ins, staking reward and NFT upgrades.\r\n\r\n* Used to unlock exclusive campaigns, rank-based NFTs, or future token access\r\n* Boosted by staking, role/badge ownership, and campaign activity\r\n* Public leaderboard with Sybil-resistance scoring system\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 5. Multichain Deployment Architecture\r\n\r\nNEFTIT is inherently multichain capable of operating across **Polygon, Base, Solana, sui, and other EVM-compatible chains**.\r\n\r\n* Projects choose their preferred chain for NFT deployment\r\n* Users can claim NFTs on-chain, till the claim NFTs will be stored in decentralised storages\r\n* Cross-chain claim bridge under development\r\n* Minimal gas UX using meta-transactions (planned)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 6. Anti-Bot & Sybil Resistance Layer\r\n\r\nTo ensure reward integrity, NEFTIT is equipped with **multiple fraud-prevention systems**:\r\n\r\n* Wallet behavior tracking (time between tasks, duplicate actions)\r\n* IP/device fingerprinting\r\n* Referral system abuse filters\r\n* Flagging logic and penalty system\r\n* Human-centric behavior scoring for real-user prioritization\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 7. Referral Engine\r\n\r\nNEFTIT includes a **built-in referral layer** to allow users to invite others and earn additional points, rank boosts, or exclusive NFTs.\r\n\r\n* Personalized referral links tied to wallet/email\r\n* Leaderboard integration and invite-tracking dashboard\r\n* Protection against fake/multi-wallet referrals\r\n* Used for viral campaign growth and waitlist traction\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 8. NFT Identity Characters (Zylo, Kysie, Dozi)\r\n\r\nNEFTIT introduces **three mascot-based NFT avatars** with distinct personalities:\r\n\r\n* **Zylo**: Represents leadership, alpha status, and first-mover advantage\r\n* **Kysie**: Embodies loyalty, consistency, and community strategy\r\n* **Dozi**: A playful disruptor, linked to surprise rewards and mystery roles\r\n\r\nThese characters form the basis of rank-based user progression, role systems, and gamified campaigns.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 9. Admin & Project Campaign Dashboard\r\n\r\nProjects and internal admins use the **NEFTIT backend dashboard** to:\r\n\r\n* Create, edit, launch, and monitor campaigns\r\n* View NFTs data of their campaign\r\n* View analytics like task completion rate, user heatmaps\r\n* Approve/ban flagged wallets or suspicious participants\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 10. User Dashboard & Profile System\r\n\r\nEvery user has access to a **personal dashboard** that shows:\r\n\r\n* Referral link and leaderboard rank\r\n* Current and past campaigns\r\n* NFTs claimed and upgrade status\r\n* NEFT Points balance\r\n* Role badge status (Zylo OG, Dozi Holder, etc.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 11. Analytics & Campaign Reporting\r\n\r\nBoth project partners and internal teams get access to deep analytics:\r\n\r\n* Campaign success metrics (CTR, task drop-off, completion rate)\r\n* User segmentation (new vs returning, device, geo)\r\n* Conversion insights (task to claim ratio, fraud score density)\r\n* Exportable CSVs and public transparency dashboards (in roadmap)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 12. Role-Based Mechanics & Community Engagement\r\n\r\nNEFTIT uses **role/badge systems** (like OG, Zylo Rank, Dozi Guardian) to unlock exclusive rewards and campaign access for community contributors.\r\n\r\n* Community can earn roles via participation, referrals, contests\r\n* Roles affect NEFT Points, NFT drops, staking power\r\n* Used to drive organic culture-building and identity-based gamification\r\n* Badge holders can access premium or limited access campaigns\r\n* Increase chances to get higher tiered NFT from campaigns\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 13. Modular Growth Infrastructure\r\n\r\nEverything in NEFTIT is modular: campaigns, NFTs, user flows, reward structures. This enables:\r\n\r\n* Permissionless future tools for builders\r\n* Self-serve campaign setup for projects\r\n* Smart contract composability\r\n* Expansion into gaming, DeFi, or creator tools\r\n"],"names":["children","_jsx","_components","strong"],"mappings":"8LAAEA,SAAA,8CAEFA,SAAA,CAAA,oDAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAmDH,SAAA,sBAAmB,gBAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAeH,SAAA,qGAAkG,6MAInLA,SAAA,gEAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,8BAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA6BH,SAAA,oBAAiB,iIAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAgIH,SAAA,mBAAgB,4FAE5LA,SAAA,iGACAA,SAAA,oFACAA,SAAA,0FACAA,SAAA,qHAIEA,SAAA,uDAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,0DAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAyDH,SAAA,qDAAkD,+JAEzGA,SAAA,sEACAA,SAAA,6EACAA,SAAA,kFACAA,SAAA,yGAIEA,SAAA,kDAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,kDAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAiDH,SAAA,2BAAwB,2KAEvEA,SAAA,qFACAA,SAAA,0FACAA,SAAA,2GAIEA,SAAA,2CAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,qBAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAoBH,SAAA,iCAA8B,8OAEhDA,SAAA,iGACAA,SAAA,qFACAA,SAAA,yGAIEA,SAAA,2DAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,+DAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA8DH,SAAA,gEAA6D,oDAEzHA,SAAA,8EACAA,SAAA,iHACAA,SAAA,gEACAA,SAAA,kGAIEA,SAAA,0DAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,uDAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAsDH,SAAA,sCAAmC,oDAEvFA,SAAA,sFACAA,SAAA,8CACAA,SAAA,mDACAA,SAAA,uDACAA,SAAA,6GAIEA,SAAA,wCAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,qBAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAoBH,SAAA,4BAAyB,+IAE3CA,SAAA,sEACAA,SAAA,2EACAA,SAAA,oEACAA,SAAA,sGAIEA,SAAA,oEAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,qBAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAoBH,SAAA,mCAAgC,2GAEhDA,SAAA,SAAM,kHACNA,SAAA,UAAO,yGACPA,SAAA,SAAM,iGAEVA,SAAA,+IAIIA,SAAA,2DAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,wCAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAuCH,SAAA,6BAA0B,uDAE/DA,SAAA,iEACAA,SAAA,sDACAA,SAAA,6EACAA,SAAA,wGAIEA,SAAA,yDAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,8BAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA6BH,SAAA,uBAAoB,+DAE/CA,SAAA,wDACAA,SAAA,gDACAA,SAAA,qDACAA,SAAA,yCACAA,SAAA,gGAIEA,SAAA,uDAEJA,SAAA,wHAEEA,SAAA,oFACAA,SAAA,uEACAA,SAAA,oFACAA,SAAA,iHAIEA,SAAA,qEAEJA,SAAA,CAAA,eAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAcH,SAAA,uBAAoB,mKAEhCA,SAAA,qFACAA,SAAA,wEACAA,SAAA,4FACAA,SAAA,kFACAA,SAAA,0GAIEA,SAAA,sDAEJA,SAAA,gJAEEA,SAAA,8DACAA,SAAA,4DACAA,SAAA,kDACAA,SAAA"}
