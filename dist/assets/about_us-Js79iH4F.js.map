Our journey began with the idea that users shouldn’t just participate—they should be **rewarded with real value**. By bridging the gap between projects and users, we enable ecosystems where **activity is recognized, engagement is meaningful, and NFTs carry true utility**.\r\n\r\n## Meet the Founder\r\n\r\nAt the heart of NEFTIT is our founder **Vishal Kharade**, who believes that the **future of Web3 depends on community-driven growth**. With a vision to make blockchain participation rewarding and accessible, He set out to create a platform that **turns ordinary users into active promoters and project champions**, while giving them NFTs that are more than collectibles—they are tools for empowerment and connection.\r\n\r\n## Our Mission\r\n\r\nOur mission is to:\r\n\r\n- Reward users for supporting projects with **utility-driven NFTs**.  \r\n- Give projects, big or small, a **fair opportunity to grow through community engagement**.  \r\n- Build a **transparent and sustainable ecosystem** where users and projects thrive together.\r\n\r\n## Our Values\r\n\r\n1. **Transparency** – Every action, reward, and benefit is clear and fair.  \r\n2. **Community First** – Growth is a team effort; users and projects succeed together.  \r\n3. **Utility Over Hype** – NFTs should have real-world or platform benefits, not just aesthetic value.  \r\n4. **Innovation** – We constantly explore new ways to **make Web3 rewarding and engaging**.  \r\n\r\n## Our Vision\r\n\r\nNEFTIT envisions a world where Web3 communities **grow organically, fairly, and sustainably**. A world where **every user feels valued** and **every project can reach its true potential** through gamified, rewarding interactions.  \r\n\r\nTogether, we are shaping the **future of decentralized engagement**—one NFT at a time.\r\n"],"names":["children","_jsx","_components","strong"],"mappings":"8LAAEA,SAAA,8BAECA,SAAA,+BAEHA,SAAA,CAAA,6CAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA4CH,SAAA,8DAA2D,0FAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAyFH,SAAA,6BAA0B,gFAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA+EH,SAAA,kFAA+E,wBAErXA,SAAA,sCAEHA,SAAA,CAAA,yCAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAwCH,SAAA,mBAAgB,2BAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA0BH,SAAA,sDAAmD,mHAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAkHH,SAAA,qEAAkE,8HAEtTA,SAAA,gCAEHA,SAAA,qEAEEA,SAAA,CAAA,6CAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA4CH,SAAA,wBAAqB,yBACjEA,SAAA,CAAA,kCAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAiCH,SAAA,0DAAuD,yBACxFA,SAAA,CAAA,WAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAUH,SAAA,0CAAuC,yEAEhDA,SAAA,uFAEEA,SAAA,iBAAc,yGACdA,SAAA,oBAAiB,kHACjBA,SAAA,sBAAmB,gIACnBA,SAAA,eAAY,wCAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAuCH,SAAA,qCAAkC,gCAEvFA,SAAA,gCAEHA,SAAA,CAAA,mDAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAkDH,SAAA,8CAA2C,mBAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAkBH,SAAA,4BAAyB,QAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAAOH,SAAA,+CAA4C,iEAE3LA,SAAA,CAAA,gCAAAC,MAAAC,EAAAC,OAAA,CAA+BH,SAAA,uCAAoC"}
