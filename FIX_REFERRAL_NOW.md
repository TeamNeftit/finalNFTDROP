# 🔧 FIX REFERRAL COUNT NOW

## ❌ PROBLEM

The `/api/apply-referral` endpoint threw a 500 error when your friend connected Discord, so the `referred_by` field was never set!

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX

### **Step 1: Check Database**

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if friend has referred_by set
SELECT 
    discord_username,
    referred_by,
    wallet_address
FROM users
WHERE discord_provider_id = '922331804206268467';
```

**If `referred_by` is NULL**, that's the problem!

### **Step 2: Manually Set Referrer**

```sql
-- Set the referrer for your friend
UPDATE users
SET referred_by = '3041A2DD'
WHERE discord_provider_id = '922331804206268467';
```

### **Step 3: Manually Increment Count**

```sql
-- Increment your referral count
UPDATE users
SET referral_completed_count = referral_completed_count + 1
WHERE referral_code = '3041A2DD';
```

### **Step 4: Verify**

```sql
-- Check your count
SELECT 
    discord_username,
    referral_code,
    referral_completed_count
FROM users
WHERE referral_code = '3041A2DD';
```

**Should show:** `referral_completed_count: 1`

### **Step 5: Refresh Your Page**

- Go back to your first account
- Press `Ctrl+R`
- Should see: **Referrals: 1** ✅

## 🔍 WHY IT FAILED

The error log shows:
```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/apply-referral 500 (Internal Server Error)
⚠️ Referral code application failed: Failed to apply referral code
```

This means when your friend connected Discord, the system tried to apply the referral code but the backend threw an error.

---

## 🚀 PERMANENT FIX

I've added better error logging. Now restart your server:

```bash
# Stop: Ctrl+C
# Start: node server.js
```

Next time someone uses your referral link, you'll see detailed error messages in the server console if it fails.
